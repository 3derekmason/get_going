# Getting 'Go'ing

## Introducing a few fundamental features of Go.

Create two modules. The first is a library which is intended to be imported by other libraries or applications. The second is a caller application which will use the first.

Topics covered -

1. Create a module -- Write a small module with functions you can call from another module.
2. Call your code from another module -- Import and use your new module.
3. Return and handle an error -- Add simple error handling.
4. Return a random greeting -- Handle data in slices (dynamically-sized arrays).
5. Return greetings for multiple people -- Store key/value pairs in a map.
6. Add a test -- Use Go's built-in unit testing features to test your code.
7. Compile and install the application -- Compile and install your code locally.
